						<h3>History of Computing Essay</h3>
						<p><h3>Ancient Computing</h3>

							Before humans developed language or any system of government computing was unnecessary as there was no need to deal with complex calculations.  Most counting could be done on the fingers or even simple tallies such as by ancient Native Americans.  Another example of this is Roman numerals which are only designed to  deal with number less than a few thousand.  The Invention of money was something that led for the need for more complex calculations to be performed.  Money is an early example of abstraction which is a fundamental of computing as it allows for more complex ideas such as farm animals, food and other commodities to be all bought and sold using a common currency.
							As money had a numerical value there was a need to perform calculations such as subtracting the price of an item from the total balance or even calculating taxes.  Early Iranians used clay balls of different whit larger balls of clay representing larger values such as 10 or 100.  This evolved into system of numerals which the Sumerians, an ancient  urban civilization used in multiplication tables baked from clay.  The earliest mechanical method of counting was the abacus which was a method of removing the order of magnitude by having a 1, 10 , 100 etc. column which removed the need for lots of stones and made it much easier to work with reducing human error.
							The Antikythera mechanism was the first mechanical computer which was used by the ancient greeks.  It was discovered in 1902 in a shipwreck of the greek island and was at first believed to be too complex to have come from the time period of the ship but it was later carbon dated to around 150 BC.  The device was created using knowledge of Greek astronomers.  The operator would turn a crank on the device and this would turn a pointer which would give information about  zodiacal band in a future date that year.
							This operates like a simple computer as it receives an input of the date and current zodiacal position, the gears process these inputs and give an output to the astronomer.  

							<h3>Medieval computing</h3>

							One of the first calculators was Pascal's calculator of the pascaline, invented by Blaise Pascal in 1642.  It could add numbers and carry digits and could multiply or divide using repeated addition and subtraction.  The success of this device was limited as the abacus could exceed the speeds of early computes even in the 20th century but Pascal was given a Royal Privilege which is the equivalent of a patent to manufacture and sell his device as it impressed the king, Louis XIV.
							Due to non decimal methods of counting such as currency and units of measure at that time, It was difficult to add and subtract them using decimal machines so he created different models for accounting which had dials with 12 and 20 rather than ten numbers to account for the fact that there were 20 sols to a livre and 12 deniers to a sol in the french currency at that time.  Most machines around today are of this type.
							This machine is different to the Antikythera as it performs the calculation with the given input as it is entered in rather than when the user turns a crank arm making it much faster.

							The Staffelwalze, German for stepped reckoner was a calculator similar to the Pascaline but it was capable of performing all four operations addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.  The device was invented by a German mathematician Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz in 1672 but was not completed until 1694.  The gears in the device were very complex and much more advanced than Pascal’s version which led to issues with reliability The machine operating by adding and subtracting many times which the pascaline could not do as it required the operator to multiply and divide manually.

							<h3>19th Century computing</h3>

							The Difference Machine designed by Charles Babbage in 1882 was a machine used to compute tables of numbers which would be useful for engineers.  The machine was accurate and fast so it meant larger tables could be produced faster without any human error which was a common problem when calculations were being performed in the heads of mathematicians.  This is what inspired Babbage to invent the machine.  The machine was mechanical and used a crank to perform operations which had to be turned manually.  BAbbage was given 1700 pounds by the british government as producing the tables manually was expensive so they hoped this machine would be economical.
							By the time the government had given 17,000 for the machine, Babbage gave up on the machine and decided to instead focus on an analytical machine which would perform much more general calculations.  The original device was then only used to produce logarithmic tables.  

							<h3>Early 20th century computing-Bombe</h3>

							Most computers in the early 20th century were made to break nazi encrypted messages from machines such as the enigma machine and the Lorenz cipher used by Nazis high in command.  Alan turing was the leader of the team of mathematicians who cracked the enigma code and gained the edge on the Germans which is said to have considerably shortened the war.  Alan Turing designed a machine called the Bombe which was able to crack the daily settings used by the germans for the enigma machine.  This allowed them to know the position of German ships in the atlantic.  The machine worked by using rotating drums which were all wired in the same way as the Enigma Machine meaning that all the combinations for the plugboard at the bottom could be worked through.
							For each combination, a current was run through one wire .  If this result lead to a logical contradiction in a comparator unit the combination was not the correct one and therefore it was ruled out.  On the other hand, if there was not contradictions, this was the correct code for that day and the combination could be plugged into an enigma machine plugboard and then the encrypted messages can be typed in and the machine would produce a plaintext output.  Sometimes the Bombe stopped on a result which was an incorrect combination.
							This could happen many times each day and the operator would record the positions on each stop.  These stops were eliminated by cryptanalysts.  When they had eliminated enough to make it feasible to manually input these plugboard combinations, they would use a modified TYPEX machine that was designed to emulate the function of an enigma machine and they could see whether or not it produced German.
							This process is far more extensive than depicted in “The Imitation Game” as it took far more work even after the Bomb had run through all the possible combinations.  After Turing finished his work at bletchley it had to remain a secret in case of another war so few people had heard of him until the 1970s when lots of the information was declassified.
							Turing was convicted of indecency in 1952 as he was a homosexual and any homosexual act was illegal at that time.
							He was forced to take drugs which would reduce his sexual urges and in 1954 he committed suicide leaving an apple by his bed which is said to be a reenactment of a scene from snow white.

							<h3>Early 20th century computing-Colossus</h3>

							Colossus was a computer again at bletchley park which was used to solve the Lorenz cipher which was used by the High level German officers.  It was again different to the Bombe as it used vacuum tubes or thermionic valves to perform boolean algebra rather than mechanical rotating drums to rule out combinations.  This is the same technology used today as most modern programming languages use boolean algebra which is commonly referred to as true and false.
							The machine was designed by a telephone engineer, Tommy Flowers who incorporated Alan Turing’s work on cryptanalysis into his machine but turing did not help design it.
							Colossus worked by reading a piece of hole punched paper as binary code which was the encrypted message and then performing operations on that to determine the Lorenz machines settings.  This code was much harder to crack than enigma as the Lorenz cipher used random key streams.
							This means the plaintext letters were combined with letters that were completely random generated by the Lorenz machine meaning there was no pattern in frequency of the letters.  Therefore they couldn't use traditional frequency analysis to crack the codes.

							<h3>Computing Generations</h3>

							A computer generation is a stage in the development of the modern computer, each stage of computer using a different technology to process information, mostly using the same basic logic as each other.  Computers today use the same type of algebra and mathematics as those in the 50s, only the processing power has changed by orders of magnitude.  

							<h3>First Generation-Vacuum Tubes 1940-1956</h3>

							The first computers to use boolean logic used an earlier version of the transistor called vacuum tubes which looked like large light bulbs.  A diode is an example of a Vacuum tube although it contains no vacuum, it only allows current to flow in one direction as electrons emitted by the heated cathode are absorbed by the positive anode.  To allow for them to function like modern transistor a control grid which is an electrode which can control the flow of current through the tube.
							This property can be used to create logic gates such as and or and not which make up the entire computer.

							<h3>Second Generation - Transistors-1956-1963</h3>

							Transistors perform exactly the same functions as vacuum tube but they are much more reliable, much smaller, cheaper, don't require airtight components and can last forever.
							Due to them being much smaller, it allowed for computers to be more accessible and meant there could be more abstraction with languages such as assembly language and even early versions of higher level languages such as COBOL(common business-oriented language) and FORTRAN(Formula Translation) which allowed simple tasks to be done in 1 or 2 lines of code and allows to programmer to avoid dealing with memory locations.
							It also means that code does work in terms of multiple bytes rather than dealing with only a few bits at a times eg. printing a string does not require the programmer to tell the computer how to draw each character as this can be built into a character set.  

							<h3>Third Generation-Integrated circuits-1964-1971</h3>

							Integrated circuits allowed for many transistors to be built into logic gates and to be put onto a single chip.,  these allowed for computers to be sold commercially as they were small enough to fit into homes.  One of these was the the BBC Micro which were designed by a company by acorn commissioned by the BBC in order to improve computer literacy.
							The IC chips meant that a single processor could be incorporated into one single chip which decreased cost as the could be built by robots rather than people.  

							<h3>Fourth Generation – Microprocessors 1972-2010</h3>

							Microprocessors are similar to Integrated circuits but instead of just part of the processing power being on a chip, all of the CPU is one a single silicon chip.  An example of this is Intel which is the leading microprocessor manufacturer with almost all commercial computers using Intel.. There are also smaller brands such as AMD.
							This technology has allowed for fast computing to be available commercially and has massively increased the computing industry so that almost everyone owns a computer.
							It has also allowed the miniaturization at a rapid rate as modern phones can have more processing power than a computer made 10 years ago.  Unfortunately we are reaching a limit to the size than each individual transistor can be as 1 transistor is only a few atoms wide and quantum effects mean that they no longer work at such a scale

							<h3>Fifth Generation – Quatum computing/Artificial Intelligence  2010-</h3>

							To overcome this problem physicists and computer scientist have to develop new ways of processing data such as quantum computing.  In quantum computing, bits are not longer used, instead qubits are used(Quantum bits) which can have more than two states 0 and 1 and also it can be both at the same times(superposition).
							Quantum computing is useful in Cryptography as it could theoretically crack many modern public key ciphers which could create an issue for security.</p>

							<h3>Decomposition</h3>
							<p>Decomposition is a technique in Computer science used to break down a complex problem into its constituent parts.
							A common example of this is object orientated programming which mean that everything is broken down into objects.
							An example of this could be a game where there are lots of the same object which can exist together as programming languages allow for different instances of objects.
							This means that instead programming each item separately you can reuse the template so that the program is broken down into smaller parts.
							These objects can also be built into a programming language such as a Button in Java. </p>
							<br/>
							<h3>Seymour Papert</h3>
							<p>Seymour Papert was a Mathematician and computer scientist.
							He was born in south africa in 1928 and dies on the 31st July 2016.
							He received a PhD in mathematics in 1952 and while in University he was a prominent activist who opposed the Apartheid.
							He was a researcher at many European universities before becoming research associate at MIT.
							He was then made co-director of MIT artificial intelligence lab.  His research often focussed on learning especially relating this to the use of computers.
							He was most famous for the development of the LOGO programming language which is often used by schools.
							It can be used to program a robot and tell it which way to move or can be used to draw graphics.
							This was called turtle graphics as the program uses a turtle object with functions such as penup and pendown which allow graphics to be drawn such as the turtle module in python.
							His death was caused by a condition related to his heart.
							His rehabilitation team who helped him with his poor speech used some the methods he devised to do with hands on learning.</p>
							
							<br/>
							<h3>Jeannette Wing</h3>
							<p>Jeannette Wing is in charge of Microsoft research and is responsible for the oversight of its core laboratories  before this she was Professor of Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University.
							She graduated from MIT with a degree in electrical engineering and computer science.
							She is a member of the formal methods community.
							Formal methods are about devising techniques which improve implementation of software and computer systems.
							She developed the Liskov substitution principle which is to do with object orientated programming and states:
							An object of one types properties must be the same as another object's properties if the first object is a subtype of the second.  
							She is a promoter of computational thinking and encourages the use of techniques used by computer scientists such as abstraction and algorithms in other Industries.<p>
							<br/>
							<h3>Dijkstra</h3>
							<p>Edsgar Dijkstra was a Dutch computer scientist who worked in Mathemtisch Centrum in Amsterdam.
							He was extremely influential in computer science at the time and was one of the pioneer.
							Go To Statement Considered Harmful was a letter which he wrote to CACM.
							In this he critisised the extensive use of GOTO statements in programming languages of the time and instead advocated for more structured programming that we have today.
							This made code clearer and It could be more easily optimised.
							Three new things were added in which are subroutines which are the same as functions in python or methods in java.
							Another structure was for loops which would repeat the block beneath them depending on specified variables used in the brackets after the “for”.
							Finally switch statements were added which can get a value of a variable go through multiple statements and find the one it should perform when it finds the value of the variable.
							This is similar to many if else statements but is clearer </p>
							<br/>
							
							<h3>Objects</h3>
							<p>Objects are used to break down a program as they are a way of resusing code without any complication of copying and pasting the same thing.
							A program can be broken down into its parts for example a GUI can have a button and a title which can both be broken down into objects which can themselves be broken down into objects such.
							The button can be a button object and have methods in the object such as setText() and setEnabled().
							The setEnabled method is unique to a button object for that could be in the button objects but setText is not Unique to a button object as it could be used in a TextView object.
							Therefore the button and TextView will both inherit the variables and methods from another class which store methods used by the GUI elements.</p>
							<br/>
							<h3>Abstractions</h3>
							<p>An abstraction is when complexity in a computer is built upon such as by using higher level programming languages.
							It is important to increase simplicity for the programmer and reduce the need for programmer to code things that can be done in assembly languages such as dealing with bits and choosing memory locations to store variables.</p>
							<br/>
							<h3>Algorithms</h3>
							<p>An algorithm is a set of instructions used by a computer of human to solve a problem.  This could be a sudoku problem.
							A human would look at each rown and eliminate the numbers that can't be in a box until there is only one left and a computer would use a similar method</p>

						<h3><b>Data Types</b></h3>
						<p>This chapter is on data types used by computers.
						Computers need to be able to recognise which data is of what type so that it can perform the appropriate function.
						For example the addition symbol means the find the sum when the data is a float or integer but for a string, it means it needs to concatenate the strings.
						The main data types used by computers are as follows:
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Character - this is a letter of digit or even a control code.  eg. "%, (, H, @, 4, ~"</li>
							<li>String -  this is a sequence of characters which can make up sentances or digits which can be displayed on the screen</li>
							<li>Boolean - this data type is a single bit which can take the value of true or false or 1 or zero</li>
							<li>Integer - These are whole non decimal positive or negative numbers</li>
							<li>Float - These are numbers which can have a decimal and be positive or negative.</li>
						</ul>
						<h3>Representing Text</h3>
						<ul>
							<li>Computers store only 1’s and 0’s</li>
							<li>ASCII was intruduced as a common standard to represent letters and symbols</li>
							<li>It means American Standard Character Information Interchange</li>
							<li>It as originally 7 bits and could represent 128 separate characters</li>
							<li>Extended ASCII increased this to 8 bits or 256 characters</li>
							<li>UNICODE originally 16 bit 65000 + characters</li>
							<li>The 16 bit restrictionwas  lifted</li>
							<li>The original ASCII takes up the first 256 characters of Unicode</li>
						</ul>
						<h3>Boolean data</h3>
						<p>This can only take two values, 0 and 1 or true and false.
						It is represented by one bit in computers.
						It can be used to signify wether a light shoud be on or off or for flagging events.  Eg. is the answer positive or is 5 > 23.</p>
						<h3>Positive Integers</h3>
						<p>Binary is used to represent numbers which can be operated on.
						It works in a similar way to the decimal system but instead of a 10^0, 10^1, 10^2 column in used Base 2, 2^0, 2^1, 2^2 etc.
						Each column can only take 2 values, 0 or 1.  This is because computers can only compare high and low voltages and nothing else.
						To convert from binary to decimal you can simpply write out the binary column headings and put the binary number below, each bit to each deading and add up the headings to get the number in decimal

						<h3>Stacks</h3><p>This chapter is about data structures.  The first data struncture is a stack.
						To help understand how this words I created an object in python which behaves like a stack.  It is linked below to download.
						The program creates a stack then performs various functions on them. 
						A Stack is a data structure which follows the rule last in, first out which is similar to a stack of books.
						They are used in scheduling algorithms which are used by computers to decide which program to give processor time.  
						There are various functions associated with stacks.  One of these is push.  This takes a parameter of an object or variable.
						It puts that object onto the stack and doesnt return anything.
						Another function is Pop which does the opposite.
						It takes the variable and removes it from the stack and returns the value of the variable.
						The peek function does the same but doesnt remove the variable.
						Fuctions such as size return the number of items in the Stack
						</p>
						<h3>Queues</h3>
						<p>Queues are simaler to stacks in that you can add and remove items from them.  
						They follow the First in First out rule like a queue in real life.  
						They are often used in computers in scheduling tasks to ensure each taks is executed in the most efficient manner.  
						An exaple below shows exactly how they work.
						This is a circular Queue meaning the index of the first item in the Queue is always 0 so there wont be empty spaces.  
						All the items are moved down in the Queue when an item is taken from the front.
						The second example shows in more detail what this does without using pythons built in functions.
